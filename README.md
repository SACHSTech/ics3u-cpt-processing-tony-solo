# Maze Run
Maze Run is a 2D top-down game where you must find your way through different mazes while avoiding obstacles. The goal is to reach the green goal at the end of each maze without getting hit once as you only have one life as quickly as possible. There are a variety of different levels with up to three different mazes. There are also two difficulties with easy and hard. Difficulties determine the interval at which obstacles appear so you must have good reaction time if you want to do hard. The controls to move are up arrow for up, down arrow for down, left arrow for left, and right arrow for right. 

Maze run combines the fun of normal mazes with obstacles that will try to ruin your time. How fast can you clear it?

Limitations:

        - Switching directions simultaneously can cause the player to stop for a very short but noticible time
        - Pressing keys other than arrows while changing direction causes player to stop moving
        - Game must be played in 800x800 resolution as levels do not scale to screen
