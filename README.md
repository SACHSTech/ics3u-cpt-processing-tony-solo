# Maze Run
Maze Run is a 2D top-down game where you traverse a maze full of obstacles within a limited amount of time to win. 

Reach the green highlighted goal while dodging the red obstacles. You only have one life so getting hit is game over you will have to restart from game one! 

There are two difficulties which make the three levels you go through easier or harder.

        Easy - no obstacles, more time
        Normal - yes obstacles, less time

Scoring is determined by time remaining + difficulty multiplier.

        More time = more score
        Easy multiplier = none
        Normal multiplier = 1.2x 

Limitations:

        - Switching directions simultaneously can cause the player to stop for a very short but noticible time
        - Pressing keys other than arrows while changing direction causes player to stop moving
        - Game must be played in 800x800 resolution as levels do not scale to screen
