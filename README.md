# Samurai Cat

Samurai Cat is a 2D platformer that is inspired by Mario and Hollow Knight. The goal is to escape from the Dog Empire by passing the levels without getting hit within the given time limit. You play as an agile cat that is equipped with a sword and heavy boots.

There are two types of enemies: one that has no weapon but hurts you when you get close and another that shoots projectiles at you with a gun. Each level will also have obstacles that can harm you including holes in the floor or spikes. Enemies can be eliminated by attacking with the sword in a close proximity or jumping on their heads. 

There are 3 difficulties that increase the number of enemies, increase projectile speed from enemies, and decrease the time available the as the difficulty progresses. Score is determined by passing in shortest amount of time and enemies killed. If the level can be passed without killing enemies, the score will receive a Pacifist Bonus Multiplier where the score will be multiplied by 3. The difficulty of the game will also grant a score multiplier with easy granting no multipler, hard granting 2.0 multiplier, and extreme granting 3.0 multiplier. 

Limitations may possibly include absence of side-scrolling camera. If side-scrolling camera is implemented, backtracking may not be possible (moving camera left).
